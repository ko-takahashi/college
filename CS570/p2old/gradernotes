I wrote this code myself while using my getword.c program for Program 1.
Since I am using getword.c from my previous Program 1, I had the assistance of Foster.
I also used the following links below:
http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/exit.2.html
    I used this to learn why _exit() was needed when dealing with child pid
https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/open.html
https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Permission-Bits.html
    I used these two to learn about specific symbols constants to use when dealing with redirection

Potential bugs and shortcomings:
When I run 'make splint' there are 3 code warnings, they do not seem to affect running the code. But there are still warnings
When dealing with !!, I was met with segmentation faults. This was from me storing newArgv into bangArgv.
Unfortuantely I was not able to solve it in time.
Not all foreground/background input/output redirection works properly

Extra Comments:
Due to redirection being complicated, I decided to split it from the main function and write an separate execute function to handle redirection
